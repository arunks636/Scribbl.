# Scribbl.
Scribbl. is a simple yet smart note-taking web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (no frameworks). It allows users to quickly create, edit, delete, and organize notes — all stored locally in your browser using LocalStorage, so your notes stay safe even after refreshing the page.

✨ Features:

📝 Add, edit, and delete notes instantly

🎨 Choose a background color for each note

🔍 Search notes by title or content in real time

🎯 Filter notes by color

🧹 Clear all notes with one click

💾 Notes persist even after reload (thanks to LocalStorage)

🪄 Clean UI with smooth modal animations

It’s a perfect beginner-friendly project to understand DOM manipulation, event handling, LocalStorage, and dynamic rendering in JavaScript.
